Hi. I am Abdulhafiz, a Computer Science student at the University of Winnipeg. 
I have knowledge of Python and experienced with APIs, Databases and Web Scraping. I am currently learning Javascript and Golang.
I have worked with FastAPI, SQL(PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy), Database migration (Alembic) and hosting platforms like Heroku and Ubuntu. I have built an API hosted on Heroku and I am currently working on
a webscraping website using Python for the scraping and Javascript(NodeJS) for the frontend. Stay tuned!
